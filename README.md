## üéØ Our Mission

This project is for students who want to eat well but are constrained by time and a tight budget. We aim to solve the "what to cook?" problem by providing personalized, affordable, and quick-to-prepare meal plans. Our goal is to make healthy eating accessible, reduce food waste, and eliminate the stress of daily meal planning.

## ‚ú® How It Works

The process is simple. You provide the application with some key information, and our AI-powered backend does the rest.

### Step 1: Tell Us About Yourself (The Inputs)

We build your profile based on a few simple questions:

-   **Food Preferences:** What cuisines do you love? (e.g., Indian, Mexican, Italian, Chinese, etc.)
-   **Weekly Budget:** How much do you want to spend on groceries?
-   **Cooking Time:** How much time can you dedicate to cooking each day?
-   **Allergies:** We take your health seriously. Let us know about any allergies.
-   **Nutrition Goals:** Are you looking to lose weight, gain muscle, or maintain your current physique?
-   **Dietary Restrictions:** We cater to all kinds of dietary needs, including:
    -   **Dietary:** Vegetarian, Vegan, Pescatarian, Paleo, Keto, etc.
    -   **Religious:** Halal, Kosher, Jain, etc.
    -   **Health-Related:** Gluten-free, Low-sodium, Diabetic-friendly, etc.
    -   And many more personal preferences and intolerances.

### Step 2: Get Your Personalized Plan (The Outputs)

Based on your inputs, our application generates:

1.  **üõí A Smart Grocery List:** An itemized list of all the ingredients you'll need for the week, carefully calculated to fit within your budget.
2.  **üóìÔ∏è A 1-Week Meal Plan:** A delicious and varied 7-day meal plan, complete with recipes you can create using the groceries you've just bought. The plan is designed to be exciting, nutritious, and perfectly aligned with your preferences.
